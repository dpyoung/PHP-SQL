# PHP-SQL
PHP and SQL projects in Web Development
To get started, drop this repo's contents into your local LAMP stack's HTML directory. Ensure PHP is enabled and that a MySQL connection is configured. Open /nm_includes/db_vars.php and configure the connection to your database accordingly. Ensure that you run /nodes.sql to add sample data to your database accordingly.
This is a pet project created over a couple weekends in my space time. Note that this was not meant to be a finished product by any means.
Enjoy!
